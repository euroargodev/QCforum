# Argo Quality Control forum

This repository is here to build a knowledge database and a forum about Quality Control (QC) of Argo data.

You can engage with the Argo QC community by posting issues at:  
https://github.com/euroargodev/publicQCforum/issues

You can share use cases and your expertise with codes (through fork and pull-request) and wiki pages:
https://github.com/euroargodev/publicQCforum/wiki

This forum is about everything related to Argo QC, for instance:
- Requests for expertise on difficult data
- Questions about QC information propagation in the Argo database (eg: greylist, netcdf fields)
- Illustration of Argo data errors and how to fix them
- Access and content of reference database
- etc ...

Rq: This repository has been set-up by the European community of nation contributors to the Argo programme. If this initiative is successfull (gathering a significant amount of information and community discussions), it will be proposed for the ADMT endorsement and transfered to https://github.com/ArgoDMQC/.
