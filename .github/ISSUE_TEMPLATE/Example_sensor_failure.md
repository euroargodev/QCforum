**Provide information about the type of sensor and/or float affected by the issue**
Eg:

The Argo 3901931 float was deployed in 2017. It is an Arvor float equipped with an SBE41CP (8497) and a Kistler pressure sensor (4940374).

**Provide context and description of the issue**
Eg:

This float had received a MIN/MAX warning starting around cycle 105 with fresher salinity values (-0.35 psu at depth). 
After analysis, it appears that there is a problem with the pressure sensor, which reports higher pressure values than the actual values. 

**Do not hesitate in provide figures to illustrate the issue**
Eg:
